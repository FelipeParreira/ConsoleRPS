# Console RPS

This is my solution to the project on the "Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors" lesson for the JavaScript Basics track (on Web Dev 101).

## Description

Here is a brief description of this project:

It is a command line version (which can be played in your JavaScript browser console) of the famous [Rock, Paper & Scissors game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock–paper–scissors). In the game, the user plays against the computer, whose choice is made randomly.
