# Console RPS

This is my solution to the project on the "Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors" lesson for the JavaScript Basics track (on Web Dev 101).

## Description

Here is a brief description of this project:

It is a command line version (which can be played in your JavaScript browser console) of the famous [Rock, Paper & Scissors game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock–paper–scissors). 

In the game, the user plays against the computer, whose choice is made randomly. Each match consists of 5 turns, at the end of which the final score is given and a message is logged to the console informing whether the player or the computer won the match. 

You can find it live [here](https://felipeparreira.github.io/ConsoleRPS/). In order to play the game, just insert your choice (rock, paper or scissors) in the prompt window displayed in the browser. To see who won each match and the game (as well as the final score), you need to open the JavaScript console in your browser.
